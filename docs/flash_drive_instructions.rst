Instructions for installing pytentiostat onto a *Windows* computer with a USB
=============================================================================

**You must have a USB drive with pytentiostat and pytent_env to use this method.**
**If you do not have such a drive, you can download the source code at** https://github.com/juami/pytentiostat
**and you will need to create your own python environment.**

- First, copy the pytentiostat folder onto your computer.
- Look inside the folder for `pytent_env` and inside that folder for a file called \
  `pytent_GUI.bat`. Double click it to run the software.
- There is also a text based version that runs in the command window which can be started \
  by double clicking `pytent_cmd.bat`.
- Refer to the main documentation in the 'docs' folder to start running experiments.

Note: You can run the software on the flash drive without having to move the folder to your \
computer. This can be useful since the folder size is ~500 Mb. The data will always be \
saved in the computer's desktop folder
