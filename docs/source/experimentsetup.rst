.. note::

    This section is designed to guide researchers through the basic steps necessary to run and electrochemical experiment
    and characterize the electrochemical behavior using the pytentiostat capabilities.

The steps below describe the steps that should be taken to prepare and electrochemical cell designed to investigate the
reduction and oxidation of potassium ferricyanide.

.. topic:: Two-electrode Experiment

   To run a two-electrode cell, there will only be a working electrode and a counter electrode. In this case, the user
   can simply attach the reference clip to the counter clip from the potentiostat and clip these to the counter electrode.
