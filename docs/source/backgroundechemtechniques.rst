Electrochemical Techniques
===========================

This page is designed to assist users in deciding which technique would best suit a given experiment. The JUAMI
potentiostat offers three techniques for testing electrochemical systems - linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic
voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. An introduction to each technique is below.
