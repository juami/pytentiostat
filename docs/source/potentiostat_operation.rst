How to Operate the JUAMI Potentiostat
=====================================

The instructions below provide a guide to running the electrochemical characterization techniques available through the
JUAMI potentiostat. These instructions assume that the sample or device is ready to be tested (all that needs to be done
is clip the leads to the electrodes). For more information, see :any:'experiment-setup'.

Start the Pytentiostat Experiment
---------------------------------

The experiments have several keyboard interrupts that break down the logical progression of the experiment once the
experiment is initiated. To start the process, use the start window to open the anaconda prompt. In the anaconda
command prompt, type

Connect the Potentiostat
------------------------

The JUAMI potentiostat has a USB-B port that can be used to communicate with a computer. Connect a USB-A to USB-B adapter
cable to the computer and the potentiostat.

To verify that the connection was made successfully, open the main.py file in the pytentiostat directory.
