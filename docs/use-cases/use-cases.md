This is where we will put our UC's, e.g.:
UC1:
1. Sun Hwi wants to test that the potentiostat is responding
2. Sun Hwi connects up the potentiostat to the computer
3. Sun Hwi runs "test-connection" script in a terminal
4. test-connection script returns status including basic metadata such as hardware addresses and status of all ports.
