Experiment Setup
=================

Three-electrode experiment
---------------------------

.. rubric:: Materials and Instrumentation

#. JUAMI Potentiostat
#. USB adapter
#. Glassware for electrochemical cell (could be three-neck flask, beaker, etc.)
#. Working electrode
#. Counter electrode
#. Reference electrode
#. Electrolyte

.. rubric:: Experiment preparation



.. rubric:: Data collection and analysis

.. note::

   To run a two-electrode cell, there will only be a working electrode and a counter electrode. In this case, the user
   can simply attach the reference clip to the counter clip from the potentiostat and clip these to the counter electrode.
