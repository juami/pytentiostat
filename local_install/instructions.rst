Instructions for installing pytentiostat with a USB
===================================================

- First, copy the entire top level directory onto a USB flash drive.
- **Important:** Download the Python 3.8 installer and required wheel files onto the USB. \
  Copy the installer to the folder 'local_install' and the wheels to its subdirectory, \
  'whls'.

  **Note:** To obtain a copy of the installer and wheel files, contact the \
  development team through Github or email. (https://github.com/juami/pytentiostat)
- Next, plug in the flash drive to the desired computer and copy \
  pytentiostat onto the computer.
- Then find the file called 'install_from_local' in the scripts folder \
  and double click it.
- Follow the prompts on the screen to install python 3.8. Be sure to select \
  'add Python to PATH' at the bottom of the first screen.
- It will take a couple of minutes to install all the packages. If everything \
  was successful, you will see no errors and the bottom of the command window \
  will say 'press any key to continue...'
- Refer to the main documentation in the 'docs' folder to start running experiments.
