### Experimental Setup:
1. GS plugs the USB cable into the computer and the potentiostat.
1. GS attaches working electrode to one side of the resistor and attaches the remaining electrodes to the other side.

### Program Setup:
1. GS copies the default example config file to an easy to navigate to directory (WD).
1. GS opens up a console window.
1. GS navigates to the WD.
1. GS types command pytentiostat.

### Pytentiostat Operation:
